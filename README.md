I've built a live sign language translator using Python, leveraging libraries like Mediapipe and its hand-tracking module, 
as well as OpenCV for real-time camera processing and TensorFlow for additional functionalities. 
This translator interprets hand signs and converts them into text, providing a readable format for users.
